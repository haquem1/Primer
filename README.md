# Primer

This web application responds to HTTP GET calls. Using the query string handle.cgi=handle.cgi will return a simple html page hosted on the server of the application. 

Any other GET call will return an html page from a remote server. 

These calls are handled via cgi interfaces written as shell scripts.
